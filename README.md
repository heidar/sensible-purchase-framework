# Sensible Purchase Framework

This framework helps you make thoughtful and intentional purchasing decisions by guiding you through a set of logical steps. It distinguishes between needs and wants, ensures you're getting the best value, and considers alternatives before making a purchase.

## How It Works

The framework starts by asking whether the item is a need or a want. If it's a want, additional pre-checks ensure the purchase aligns with your long-term goals and isn't just an impulsive decision. Once those checks are passed, both needs and wants go through a shared set of questions to determine the best approach to buying the item.

You can copy the code into any Mermaid-compatible tool (such as [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid-live-editor/)) to visualize or modify it.
